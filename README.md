The Wiki Game (Alpha)
========

A Chrome Extension experiment - a research game using Wikipedia. Inspired by a pastime game played manually by co-workers.

The object is to be the first person to reach an arbitrary target page by creating a click path from one wiki article to another.

Pubnub used for real-time push communication between Wikipedia and the extension, localStorage used to persist some data.
