wikigame
========

A Chrome Extension experiment - a research game using Wikipedia.

The object is to be the first person to reach an arbitrary target page by creating a click path from one wiki article to another.

Pubnub used for real-time push communication between Wikipedia and the extension.

Still in **early alpha**.
